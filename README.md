## Why make this?
Programmers and web developers often waste time creating good quality read-me files instead of focusing on the task ahead. This application automatically generates one for you in minutes!

## My goal
The goal was to simplify the creation process of read-me files by using npm packages and node intergartion. 

## Running the application

Here you will need to run the index.js file in the intergrated terminal on mac.

## Filling out the prompts

Here the computer will ask for information that will apply to the read me file.
